<h2 align="center">Descriptive Analysis of Project 1: Analyzing Issued Building Permits in Vancouver</h2>
## Project Description:
Perform a descriptive analysis of building permits in Vancouver using AWS services to ingest, process, and analyze data efficiently, focusing on the **Project Value** of properties for the years 2023 and 2024.

### Objective:
This project aims to demonstrate how to ingest, process, and analyze Vancouver's building permit dataset using AWS services. The analysis focuses on understanding the **Project Value** for the years 2023 and 2024 to uncover key trends and insights.

## Understanding Building Permits in Vancouver: A Descriptive Analysis Using AWS

### 1. **Project Title**
**Analyzing Issued Building Permits in Vancouver for 2023 and 2024**

### 2. **Dataset**
The dataset includes building permit data sourced from the [Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/).

**Key Features:**
- **Project Value**: The value of the building project.
- **Permit Issue Date**: The date on which the permit was issued.

### 3. **Methodology**
#### **Data Collection and Preparation**
- The dataset was downloaded in **Excel format** and ingested into **AWS S3** for secure storage.

#### **Data Cleaning and Structuring**
- Data was cleaned using **AWS Glue DataBrew** to address missing values.
- The dataset was structured for analysis, focusing primarily on **Project Value** and **Permit Issue Date**.

#### **Data Storage and Pipeline**
- Data was stored in an **AWS S3 bucket** for easy access and processing.
- A data pipeline was designed using **AWS Glue** to automate the steps.

#### **Data Analysis**
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode) were calculated using **AWS Athena**.
- Queries focused on summarizing the **Project Value** across different time periods.

#### **Data Visualization**
- Visualizations were created to highlight trends in project values and permit issuance.

### 4. **Screenshots from AWS Services**
Here are some key screenshots of the processes performed using AWS:

- **Data Storage in S3:**

### 5. **Tools and Technologies**
- **AWS S3**: For data storage.
- **AWS Glue DataBrew**: For data cleaning.
- **AWS Athena**: For running queries.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: (e.g., AWS QuickSight or Matplotlib).

### 6. **Insights and Findings**
- The analysis revealed the distribution of project values over 2023 and 2024.
- Key trends in the issuance of building permits were identified.

### 7. **Deliverables**
- A report summarizing the findings.
- Visualizations to illustrate key insights.
