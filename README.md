## Project Description:
Perform a descriptive analysis of building permits in Vancouver using AWS services to ingest, process, and analyze data efficiently, focusing on the **Project Value** of properties for the years 2023 and 2024.

### Objective:
This project aims to demonstrate how to ingest, process, and analyze Vancouver's building permit dataset using AWS services. The analysis focuses on understanding the **Project Value** for the years 2023 and 2024 to uncover key trends and insights.

## Understanding Building Permits in Vancouver: A Descriptive Analysis Using AWS

### 1. **Project Title**
**Analyzing Issued Building Permits in Vancouver for 2023 and 2024**

### 2. **Dataset**
The dataset includes building permit data sourced from the [Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/).

**Key Features:**
- **Project Value**: The value of the building project.
- **Permit Issue Date**: The date on which the permit was issued.

### 6. **Insights and Findings**
The data analysis of Vancouver's building permits provided several important insights that can inform future urban development and project planning initiatives for the City of Vancouver:

- **Significant Increase in High-Value Projects in 2024**: Our analysis revealed a notable surge in high-value projects in 2024, especially in the residential sector. This trend could signal increased urban development in key districts, potentially spurred by favorable zoning policies or economic incentives. This shift will likely place a greater demand on city infrastructure and public services.
  
- **Concentration of Permits in Specific Districts**: The majority of permits issued during this period were concentrated in rapidly growing districts such as the **Mount Pleasant** and **Downtown Vancouver** areas. This concentration of activity may suggest targeted investment in high-growth regions, but it also highlights the potential for uneven urban development, which may require policy adjustments to ensure balanced growth across the city.

- **Residential vs. Commercial Project Distribution**: The analysis revealed that residential projects vastly outnumbered commercial ones. This may suggest a housing boom driven by population growth or increased demand for residential spaces. The City of Vancouver might need to prepare for increased strain on residential infrastructure and services.

- **Time Gaps Between Permit Application and Issuance**: A noteworthy finding was the inconsistency in the time taken between permit application and issuance, which ranged from several days to months. This could point to potential inefficiencies within the approval process that the city might need to address to streamline development and support economic growth.

- **Contractor Patterns and Preferences**: The data suggested a recurring set of contractors handling high-value projects, which could be indicative of trusted relationships between the city and certain developers. Monitoring these patterns could help ensure fair distribution of opportunities among contractors and maintain healthy competition in the local construction market.

These insights will help city officials, urban planners, and decision-makers better understand the landscape of urban development and tailor their strategies to meet the evolving needs of Vancouver's residents and businesses.


### 7. **Deliverables**
The following key deliverables were produced as part of this project, each contributing to a thorough understanding of Vancouver's building permit landscape and providing actionable insights for city officials:

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis Report**: A detailed report documenting the entire analysis process, including data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis, using AWS services. This report highlights key trends, insights, and potential areas for policy adjustment in urban development.
  
- **Interactive Dashboards (AWS QuickSight)**: Visual dashboards showcasing the distribution of building permits by project value, geographical distribution, and time of issuance. These interactive visualizations will allow city planners to filter data by district, contractor, or project type to make real-time decisions.
  
- **Athena Query Results**: An organized set of SQL queries run via **AWS Athena**, which city officials can reuse or modify to explore further data points such as permit issuance time, contractor performance, and project delays.

- **AWS Pipeline Documentation**: A documented pipeline flowchart outlining how the data flows from ingestion (S3) to analysis (Athena) and visualization. This will help technical staff understand how the data pipeline was built and provide a foundation for future projects or data extensions.
  
- **Cost Analysis Using AWS Pricing Calculator**: A detailed breakdown of the estimated costs involved in running the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) using AWS services, including S3 storage, Glue DataBrew, Athena, and QuickSight. This will allow city officials to assess the long-term financial feasibility of maintaining and scaling the platform.
  
- **Recommendations for Process Improvement**: Based on the analysis, we have provided a set of actionable recommendations aimed at optimizing the building permit issuance process and ensuring more balanced urban development across Vancouver's districts.
  
These deliverables not only provide actionable insights for the present but also lay the foundation for future scalability and more efficient city planning workflows.
